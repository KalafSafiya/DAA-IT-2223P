# Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort & Insertion Sort in MATLAB

This README explains the functionality and working of two basic sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort, along with sample outputs.

## Bubble Sort

### Functionality:
Bubble Sort is a simple, comparison-based algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until the entire array is sorted.

### How It Works:
- Start at the beginning of the array.
- Compare each pair of adjacent elements.
- Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
- Repeat this for all elements, reducing the range each time (since the largest elements move to the end).
- Continue until no more swaps are needed, indicating the array is sorted.

## Insertion Sort

### Functionality:
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one item at a time. It is efficient for small datasets and works similarly to how people sort playing cards in their hands.

### How It Works:
- Start from the second element in the array.
- Compare it with elements before it.
- Shift larger elements one position to the right.
- Insert the current element into its correct position.
- Repeat this process for all elements in the array.
